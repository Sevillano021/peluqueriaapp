# Hair Salon Application Test Report

## Summary
The hair salon application has been tested with a focus on the booking functionality that was previously failing. While most of the application is working correctly, there is still an issue with the reservation creation endpoint that prevents users from completing the booking process.

## Test Results

### Backend API Testing

| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| GET /api/ | ✅ PASS | Root endpoint returns correct response |
| GET /api/servicios | ✅ PASS | Returns list of services correctly |
| GET /api/peluqueros | ✅ PASS | Returns list of stylists correctly |
| GET /api/horarios-disponibles/{fecha}/{peluquero} | ✅ PASS | Returns available time slots correctly |
| POST /api/reservas | ❌ FAIL | Returns 500 Internal Server Error |
| GET /api/reservas | ✅ PASS | Returns list of reservations correctly |
| GET /api/reservas/{fecha} | ✅ PASS | Returns reservations for a specific date correctly |

### Frontend UI Testing

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Initial page load | ✅ PASS | Page loads correctly with all UI elements |
| Step 1: Service selection | ✅ PASS | Services are displayed and can be selected |
| Step 2: Stylist and date selection | ✅ PASS | Stylists and date picker work correctly |
| Step 3: Time slot selection | ✅ PASS | Available time slots are displayed and can be selected |
| Step 4: Contact information | ✅ PASS | Form fields work correctly |
| Reservation submission | ❌ FAIL | API call fails with 500 error |
| Confirmation page | ❌ FAIL | Not displayed due to API error |

## Issue Details

The reservation creation endpoint (/api/reservas) is failing with a 500 Internal Server Error. The error logs show:

```
ValueError: [TypeError("'ObjectId' object is not iterable"), TypeError('vars() argument must have __dict__ attribute')]
```

This is a MongoDB ObjectId serialization error. When the backend tries to return the reservation data after creating it, it's trying to serialize a MongoDB ObjectId, which is not directly JSON serializable.

### Root Cause

The issue is in the FastAPI JSON encoder when it tries to serialize the response. There's a MongoDB ObjectId in the response that's not being properly converted to a string.

Looking at the server.py code, line 154 uses `str(uuid.uuid4())` to generate a unique ID for the reservation:

```python
"id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
```

This should be working correctly to create a string UUID rather than using MongoDB's ObjectId. However, when MongoDB inserts the document, it adds its own `_id` field with an ObjectId, and that field is being included in the response.

The code tries to exclude the `_id` field in the `get_reservas` function with `{"_id": 0}`, but it's not doing the same in the reservation creation function.

## Recommendations

1. Modify the `crear_reserva` function to exclude the MongoDB `_id` field from the response:

```python
# Return the reservation without MongoDB-specific fields
reserva_response = nueva_reserva.copy()
# Ensure _id is not included in the response
if '_id' in reserva_response:
    del reserva_response['_id']
return {"message": "Reserva creada exitosamente", "reserva": reserva_response}
```

2. Alternatively, add a custom JSON encoder for MongoDB ObjectId:

```python
from bson import ObjectId
import json

class CustomJSONEncoder(json.JSONEncoder):
    def default(self, obj):
        if isinstance(obj, ObjectId):
            return str(obj)
        return super().default(obj)

# Configure FastAPI to use this encoder
app = FastAPI(json_encoder=CustomJSONEncoder)
```

3. Ensure all MongoDB queries exclude the `_id` field:

```python
# When returning documents from MongoDB
result = reservas_collection.find({}, {"_id": 0})
```

## Conclusion

The application is mostly working correctly, but the reservation creation functionality is still broken due to a MongoDB ObjectId serialization issue. Once this issue is fixed, users should be able to complete the full booking process and see the confirmation page with their reservation details.
